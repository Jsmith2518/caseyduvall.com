This is a simple landing page I created in 2019 to have something available on [caseyduvall.com](caseyduvall.com). It looks nice and loads very quickly, and offers a few links to things like my [GitHub](https://github.com/d00vy) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-duvall/) profiles, my [personal website](https://d00vy.com/) and email, and a downloadable PDF copy of my resume.

Nothing special about the design, just a brief customization of [Aerial by HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/aerial).
