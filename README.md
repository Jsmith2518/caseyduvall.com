This is my adaptation of Aerial by HTML5 UP.  
So far I have:  
*removed the overlay  
*changed background image and opacity (source.unsplash.com)  
*added RSS feed reader widget (www.surfingwaves.com)  
*changed transition animations speed  


Work in progress:  
  ~~RSS feed to pull from blog  
    RSS feed formatting  
    RSS feed source URL~~  
  ~~Link updates~~  
  Responsiveness (page doesn't react properly to changes in size)  
  ~~Hosting on Netlify~~
