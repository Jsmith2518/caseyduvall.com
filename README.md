This is a simple landing page I created in 2019 to have something available on [caseyduvall.com](caseyduvall.com). It looks nice and loads very quickly, and offers a few links to things like my [GitHub]() and [LinkedIn]() profiles, my [personal website]() and email, and a downloadable PDF copy of my resume.

Nothing special about the design, just a brief customization of [Aerial by HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/aerial).
